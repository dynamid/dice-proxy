# DICE HTTP Proxy

This is a simple transparent HTTP proxy that detects common search engine queries, and puts query data into a MongoDB database.

## Supported sites

* Google
* Bing
* Yahoo!
* Wikipedia

## What works and not

* The proxy works for any HTTP connection. It also detects requests on other ports than 80.
* It does not support HTTPS connections.
* Some streaming / websocket connections as used by sites such as Youtube won't work through this proxy.

## Dependencies

Runtime:

* [Scala 2.9.1](http://www.scala-lang.org/)
* [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/)

Development:

* [Apache BuildR](http://buildr.apache.org/)
* [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) (required to run BuildR)
* [Twitter Finagle](http://twitter.github.com/finagle/) (automatically fetched by BuildR)
* [Netty](http://netty.io/) (automatically fetched by BuildR as Finagle dependency)
* [Casbash](http://api.mongodb.org/scala/casbah/current/) (automatically fetch by BuildR)
* (other misc. dependencies fetched as dependencies of the projects above)

Those are fairly easy to install dependencies.

Apache BuildR can be installed using Ruby gems: `gem install buildr`. Scala is automatically downloaded by BuildR to compile, but it remains best to install it system-wide for the runtime.

If you are on MacOSX using [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/), then installing the dependencies is as simple as:

    brew install scala
    brew install mongodb
    gem install buildr

## Building

Building is based on the common BuildR tasks, such as `buildr compile` or `buildr package`.

Other tasks are available too (see `buildr -T` to list them all):

* `buildr execute` launches the application
* `buildr dist` will create a distributable ZIP image of the application along with a `run.sh` script.

## Running

Use the distributable image and launch `run.sh`.

Alternatively you may assemble a classpath from the dependencies being put in the exploded image folder, and run the `dice.searchengine.httpproxy.SearchEngineHttpProxy` main class.

You will also need a working MongoDB instance. In development mode, I suggest that you use it with the provided configuration file called `mongod.conf`:

    mkdir db-mongodb
    mongod run --config=mongod.conf

You can tweak the MongoDB configuration as you want to add replication and sharding support. This is all transparent to the HTTP proxy application, and you can even start a cluster of those!

## Use it with a web browser

If you don't know how to configure a proxy for your web server then Google is your friend.

## Recognizing new search engines

A search engine is defined as a partial function through the following trait:

    trait SearchEngineProcessor extends PartialFunction[String, SearchEngineQuery] {
    
      /**
       * Regular expression to check is a URI corresponds to those a given search engine.
       */
      def searchEngineTest: Regex
    
      /**
       * Regular expression to extract a query string from a URI.
       */
      def queryExtractor: Regex
    
      /**
       * Regular expression to split a query string into keywords.
       */
      def keywordSplitter: Regex
      
      /**
       * Symbolic name for the search engine.
       */
      def name: String
    
      def isDefinedAt(uri: String) = searchEngineTest.findFirstIn(uri).isDefined
    
      def apply(uri: String): SearchEngineQuery = {
        val query = queryExtractor.findFirstMatchIn(uri).get.group(1)
        val keywords = keywordSplitter.split(query)
    
        SearchEngineQuery(query, keywords)
      }
    }

The variance is captured by regular expressions. For example here is how Google queries can be captured:

    class GoogleSearch extends SearchEngineProcessor {
      val searchEngineTest = "www.google.*q=.*".r
      val queryExtractor = "q=([^&]*)".r
      val keywordSplitter = "(%20)|(\\+)".r
      val name = "google"
    }

Processors can then be elegantly chained as partial functions, then lifted to form a single function returning an optional type, such as in:

    val searchEngineProcessor = (google orElse bing orElse yahoo orElse wikipedia).lift

Thus:

    searchEngineProcessor("http://www.autosport.com/")
    => None
    
    searchEngineProcessor("http://www.google.com/?q=les+muscles+merguez+party")
    => Some(SearchEngineQuery(
        "les+muscles+merguez+party",
        Seq("les", "muscles", "merguez", "party"),
        "google"
       ))

## Why *xyz*?

* Twitter Finagle: because it is a fairly well-tested asynchronous server stack, and it works on the JVM.
* Scala: because of Twitter Finagle and that their Java API was much more verbose. At last, there are people who write maintainable Scala code, see [Effective Scala](http://twitter.github.com/effectivescala/).
* BuildR: because I can't get my head around Scala's SBT, and because Maven was just too rigid for the need.
* MongoDB: because it is a solid NoSQL database, and that their Scala driver API (Casbah) is so easy.
